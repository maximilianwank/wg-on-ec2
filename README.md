# :dragon: wg-on-ec2

Create a [WireGuard速](https://www.wireguard.com/) server with as little configuration as possible.

## :receipt: Short Description

The CloudFormation template in this repository will

1. Deploy an EC2 instance
2. Add security groups only opening two ports (for WireGuard速 and SSH from a single IP)
3. Install WireGuard速 and other small dependencies
4. Configure a WireGuard速 server with suitable client configuration files

## :magic_wand: Deployment

As mentioned above, there is almost nothing to configure except the source IP address and the certificate for SSH access.

1. If necessary: Create a key pair for EC2 in the AWS account you want to use.
2. Go to CloudFormation and upload the CloudFormation template `cloudformation.yaml`.
3. Specify the key and [IP address](https://checkip.amazonaws.com/) for the SSH connection later.
4. Create the CloudFormation stack.
5. After a while there will be a zip archive on the EC2 instance at `/home/ubuntu/clients.zip` containing 255 client configurations (each as a file and a QR code). Use for example `scp` to download it.
6. Unpack the zip archive and distribute the client configurations.

## :point_up: Remarks

* The lack of configuration options is considered a feature of this project - a more flexible approach can be found in the repositorty [wireguard-on-ec2](https://github.com/LINALIN1979/wireguard-on-ec2) by [LINALIN1979](https://github.com/LINALIN1979).
* It's generally a bad idea to pipe scripts from the internet directly to `bash`.
